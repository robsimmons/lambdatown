UserLanguage
The language that a user would be allowed to write. It's important to 
specify this, because we know that users aren't actually allowed to specify
modal variables under substitutions; lowering can be made simpler by
relying on this.

ExternalLanguage
The full language of the non-normal forms of contextual modal type theory; the 
external language would really be best defined by translation into this 
language.

RaisedLanguage
This is the canonical forms version of CMTT where all modal vars are defined
in an empty context.

LoweredLanguage 
This is the canonical forms version of CMTT where all modal vars are defined
